                <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We are vapers ourselves, first and foremost.

    The idea of Vape Supply Co began in September of 2011 when the domain name vapesupplyco.com was purchased. We were tired of navigating ugly websites that were difficult to use and wading through page after page of substandard, overpriced gear and mediocre (at best) juice from overseas or juice that is made in a kitchen or basement. Instead, we wanted to offer a wide range of quality products that are competitively priced on an easy to navigate site.

    We also wanted to offer a superior customer service experience from the beginning of the purchase and retain our customers, not just make a quick buck.

    Since 2011, Vape Supply has grown into many different retail locations and built a state-of-the-art juice lab in which we mix our premium juice line.We bring you the most delicious juice and coolest new vape gear on the market at a competitive price with great customer service. We hope you have fun browsing the site.</p>
